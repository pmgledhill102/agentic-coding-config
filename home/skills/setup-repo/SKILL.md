# Configure GitHub repository settings

> **Note:** This command uses `gh repo edit` and `gh api` to modify remote GitHub settings. Each call will prompt for approval.

## Modes

| Invocation | What runs |
| --- | --- |
| `setup-repo` | The full baseline — steps 1–8 below |
| `/setup-repo --labels-only` | **Step 7 only** (work-tracking labels), then a short confirmation. Skips repo settings, merge strategy, secret scanning, branch rules and verification entirely |

`--labels-only` exists for **infra and secondary repos** that will never get the full treatment — a Terraform-only sibling repo, a fork used as a mirror — but that still need the `P0`–`P4` / `type: *` label set so cross-repo Issues filed against them can follow the convention in `agentic-coding-config` `docs/github-issues-workflow.md`. Without it such repos carry only GitHub's defaults and `gh issue create --label "type: task,P2"` fails.

Step 7's established-taxonomy guard applies **unchanged** in this mode: a repo with a purposeful labelling scheme of its own is still left alone.

## What to configure

### 1. Detect current state

Before making changes, gather the current repository configuration:

- Run `gh repo view --json name,owner,defaultBranchRef,deleteBranchOnMerge,mergeCommitAllowed,squashMergeAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed,isPrivate,hasWikiEnabled,hasProjectsEnabled` to get repo metadata
- Read branch rules from **both layers**. Classic protection and rulesets can apply to the same branch, most-restrictive-wins, so the blocking rule can hide in either — an audit that reads one layer gets a wrong answer:
  - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets` to list rulesets, and `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{default_branch}"` for the effective ruleset rules on the default branch
  - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{default_branch}/protection` for classic protection. **A 404 here means "no classic rule", not "unprotected"** — a repo governed only by a ruleset 404s on this endpoint, which reads exactly like an unprotected default branch unless the ruleset endpoints are read too
- Check if `.github/workflows/` exists and list workflow files to detect CI

Display a summary table showing **current vs proposed** values before applying any changes. Where current state contradicts the estate standard — linear history required, merge commits disabled, a required context no run reports — name the contradiction explicitly: a re-run on an already-configured repo is a drift repair, and the diff is the point.

### 2. Repository settings

Apply all settings in a single `gh repo edit` call:

```sh
gh repo edit \
  --delete-branch-on-merge \
  --enable-merge-commit \
  --enable-squash-merge \
  --enable-rebase-merge=false \
  --enable-auto-merge \
  --allow-update-branch \
  --enable-wiki=false \
  --enable-projects=false
```

**Why both merge-commit and squash, and never rebase.** Merge-commit is the default (see the Git Workflow section of the user's global agent policy): squash replaces a branch's commits with a new SHA, so anything stacked on it re-applies work `main` already has. Rebase-merge shares that defect and offers no cleanup in return, so it is disabled outright rather than left as a tempting third button. Squash stays enabled for the case it is actually good at — a branch carrying WIP or fixup commits.

GitHub has no "default merge method" field; the only levers are these three booleans, so leaving rebase enabled is what lets it drift back into use.

**`--enable-auto-merge` is conditional on a required check existing.** Without one, `gh pr merge --auto` merges *immediately* — the "wait for CI" everyone assumes comes from the ruleset, not the flag. If step 5 will have no `required_status_checks` rule (no CI yet), drop this flag.

If wiki or projects are currently enabled, note this in the summary but still disable them. Most hobby projects don't use these features.

### 3. Merge commit message formats

Set both message formats, so whichever method a PR uses produces a useful commit subject:

```sh
gh repo edit --enable-squash-merge --squash-merge-commit-message pr-title
gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo} -f merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE -f merge_commit_message=PR_BODY
```

`--enable-squash-merge` must be in the **same invocation** as `--squash-merge-commit-message` even though step 2 already enabled it: `gh` gates the message flag on the enable flag being present in the same call. Without it, `gh repo edit` prints its help text, exits 0, and applies nothing — the output looks like documentation, not an error, so check that it actually applied.

The merge-commit format needs the API directly: `gh repo edit` has **no** `--merge-commit-title`/`--merge-commit-message` flags, only the squash pair. The API also accepts just three title/message combinations — `PR_TITLE`+`PR_BODY`, `PR_TITLE`+`BLANK`, and the default `MERGE_MESSAGE`+`PR_TITLE`. Anything else returns a 422 naming the valid set. `PR_TITLE`+`PR_BODY` is the one that matches what squash does with `pr-title`, so `main`'s log reads the same whichever method a PR used.

### 4. Secret scanning (public repos only)

If the repository is **public**, enable secret scanning and push protection:

```sh
gh repo edit --enable-secret-scanning --enable-secret-scanning-push-protection
```

If the repository is **private**, skip this step and note: "Secret scanning requires GitHub Advanced Security (paid) for private repos. Skipping."

### 5. Branch rules (the standard ruleset)

Branch rules follow
[`docs/github-standards.md`](https://github.com/pmgledhill102/agentic-coding-config/blob/main/docs/github-standards.md):
**rulesets are the standard; classic branch protection is legacy.** This step
applies a ruleset, and migrates any classic rule step 1 found (see below).
Where this skill and that document disagree, the document wins and this skill
has a bug.

Determine the CI status check names to require. Prefer deriving them from an **actual completed run** — `gh pr checks <n>` on a recent PR, or `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs --jq '.check_runs[].name'` — rather than reading the workflow YAML: the rendered check name can differ from the job key, and a wrong string here blocks every PR (see below). Fall back to reading `name:` values from `pull_request`-triggered jobs in `.github/workflows/` only when no run exists yet.

Two hazards to warn the user about while doing this:

- **Required checks are a rename trap.** Rules store check names as opaque strings. Rename or remove a CI job and the old name is required forever, never reports, and every PR is blocked with no failing check to point at — nothing warns you. Whenever a CI job is renamed, removed, or a language port swaps one check for another, the required contexts must be updated in the same change.
- **Path-filtered jobs cannot be required checks.** A job behind a `paths:` filter never reports on PRs it skips, so PRs touching other files block forever. `setup-common` and the language skills deliberately suggest path filters — those jobs are ineligible; only require checks that run on every PR.

**Assert the contexts list; never merge it with what is already required.**
The list derived from live runs is authoritative — apply it as the complete
replacement, and treat any currently-required context that no completed run
reports as stale: remove it and name it in the summary. Stale contexts
accumulate silently and only surface as a blocked PR: one repo required both
`prod` and `prod / terraform`, which are mutually exclusive by construction
(a reusable-workflow caller reports the bare name when skipped and the
composite when it runs), so **no possible PR could merge** — and nothing
caught it until the next PR, months after the rename that caused it.

Whether required contexts should be one aggregate gate rather than per-job
names is deferred estate-wide
([gcp-org-management#503](https://github.com/pmgledhill102/gcp-org-management/issues/503));
until that lands, require the per-job names a real run reports.

Apply **one ruleset** targeting the default branch. Create it with
`gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets --input <file>`; if step 1 found
an existing ruleset for the default branch, update it in place with
`gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/{ruleset_id} --input <file>`
rather than creating a second one. Do not use heredocs to pass the JSON —
write a temporary file and pass it with `--input`.

The payload is the spec's `protected` ruleset. Take it from there rather
than retyping it, so this skill cannot drift from the standard:

```sh
SPEC="${CLAUDE_STANDARDS_SPEC:-$HOME/.claude/standards/github-repo.json}"
jq '.tiers.protected.ruleset' "$SPEC" > ruleset.json
```

The spec ships `required_status_checks` with an **empty** contexts list,
deliberately (its `no-fake-contexts` invariant: a context string that never
reports blocks every PR forever, so the spec must not be able to ship one).
Fill it from the names derived above, or drop the rule when the repo has no
CI:

```sh
# CI exists: require exactly the detected contexts
jq --argjson ctx '[{"context":"ci"},{"context":"lint"}]' \
  '(.rules[] | select(.type == "required_status_checks")
     | .parameters.required_status_checks) = $ctx' ruleset.json > ruleset.final.json

# no CI: omit the rule rather than requiring an empty list
jq 'del(.rules[] | select(.type == "required_status_checks"))' ruleset.json > ruleset.final.json
```

On a surface where `~/.claude/standards/` was not delivered, read the raw
copy of `home/standards/github-repo.json` from this repo's `main` — never
reconstruct the payload from memory.

- Approvals are 0 because this is a single-human estate: requiring an approval the same human must give adds a click, not a control — the PR and its CI are the control
- The **empty bypass list is what `enforce_admins` bought under classic protection**: with no bypass actors the rules bind admin-level tokens and coding agents too. Add the narrowest actor only when something concretely breaks without it
- `strict_required_status_checks_policy: true` requires the branch to be up-to-date before merging
- **Never add a `required_linear_history` rule.** Linear history forbids merge commits on the branch regardless of the repo-level toggles from step 2, so a repo with both applied cannot merge a PR at all by the sanctioned route — and the failure appears at merge time on an approved, green PR, long after the setting that caused it. It reads like a tidy-up worth restoring; it isn't

If the repo has no CI workflows, omit the `required_status_checks` rule
entirely rather than requiring an empty list. The ruleset still prevents
direct pushes and enforces PRs. Two follow-ups in that case: suggest running
`setup-common` to add CI, and **do not leave auto-merge enabled** — with no
required check, `gh pr merge --auto` merges *immediately* (the
never-combination in the standards doc), so drop `--enable-auto-merge` from
step 2 or disable it until a check exists.

**Migrate classic protection on touch.** If step 1 found a classic rule on the
default branch:

1. Fold what it required that the standard also wants — the status-check contexts, after the staleness pass above — into the ruleset payload
2. Apply the ruleset and confirm it took effect (step 8)
3. Delete the classic rule: `gh api -X DELETE repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{default_branch}/protection`. Leaving both layers active means most-restrictive-wins, so a future blocking rule can hide in either — one mechanism collapses the search space

One migration hazard where the repo runs Dependabot auto-merge: auto-merge has
been reported to stop firing after a ruleset migration (the standards doc
carries the references). Watch the first Dependabot PR through end-to-end
after converting.

### 6. Default branch name check

If the default branch is `master` instead of `main`, **do not rename it automatically**. Renaming is disruptive (breaks CI, open PRs, local clones). Instead, display a warning with the manual steps:

```text
Warning: Default branch is 'master'. Consider renaming to 'main':
  git branch -m master main
  git push -u origin main
  gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo} -f default_branch=main
  git push origin --delete master
```

### 7. Work-tracking labels

*This is the step `--labels-only` runs on its own (see Modes above).*

**Guard: skip this step in repos with an established label taxonomy.** Run
`gh label list` first — if the repo already has a purposeful labelling scheme
(e.g. `lifeos`, whose `kind:`/`effort:`/`area:`/`list:` labels are a format
contract parsed by its mobile apps), do NOT add the standard set; the local
taxonomy is authoritative. Only bootstrap repos with default/no labels.

Create the standard work-tracking label set (see `agentic-coding-config`
`docs/github-issues-workflow.md`). `--force` makes this idempotent —
existing labels are updated, not duplicated:

```sh
gh label create "P0" --color b60205 --description "Critical" --force
gh label create "P1" --color d93f0b --description "High" --force
gh label create "P2" --color fbca04 --description "Medium" --force
gh label create "P3" --color 0e8a16 --description "Low" --force
gh label create "P4" --color c5def5 --description "Backlog" --force
gh label create "type: epic" --color 1d76db --force
gh label create "type: feature" --color 1d76db --force
gh label create "type: task" --color 1d76db --force
gh label create "type: bug" --color 1d76db --force
```

### 8. Verify

In `--labels-only` mode, verify with `gh label list` alone — confirm the nine labels exist — and stop. Do not touch repo settings or branch protection.

After a full run, verify the configuration took effect:

- Diff the repository settings against the spec, key for key, in the API's
  own field names so nothing is translated by hand. Use `protected` for a
  repo without auto-merge; add the `automerge` overlay where it has it:

  ```sh
  SPEC="${CLAUDE_STANDARDS_SPEC:-$HOME/.claude/standards/github-repo.json}"
  jq -S '.tiers.protected.repository' "$SPEC" > expected.json
  # auto-merge repo: jq -S '.tiers.protected.repository + .tiers.automerge.repository' "$SPEC" > expected.json
  gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}" \
    | jq -S --slurpfile e expected.json 'with_entries(select(.key | IN($e[0] | keys[])))' > actual.json
  diff expected.json actual.json && echo "repository settings match the spec"
  ```

  A non-empty diff is a **stop-and-fix**, not a line in the summary. A
  mismatch here that was noted and not acted on is how 29 repos ended up
  with merge commits disabled (#352): re-run the failing step and diff
  again before reporting done.
- Run `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{default_branch}" --jq '[.[].type]'` and confirm the effective rules are the spec's `rules_required` for the tier (`jq '.tiers.protected.rules_required' "$SPEC"`), plus `required_status_checks` where CI exists — and specifically that `required_linear_history` is **absent**: if present, merge commits are blocked and step 5 did not apply as intended
- Where step 5 migrated a classic rule, confirm `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{default_branch}/protection` now returns 404 — here that is the desired end state, meaning the ruleset alone carries the rules
- Confirm the required contexts equal the derived list exactly — no extras surviving from before
- Display a final summary showing all applied settings

## Important

- This command modifies **remote GitHub settings**, not local files. It is safe to re-run (idempotent) — and re-running is how drift gets repaired: settings set once and never re-asserted are how stale contexts and contradicted policy accumulate.
- The ruleset PUT replaces the entire ruleset document. If a repo carries custom rules, review the current config (step 1) before overwriting.
- Rulesets on **private** repos require GitHub Pro. If the API returns a 403, explain this to the user.
- The **empty bypass list** is the setting that matters most for agent safety — an actor on the bypass list skips every other rule, admin tokens included.
- Required status check names are stored as opaque strings — remind the user that renaming a CI job later silently orphans the requirement and blocks all PRs until the ruleset is updated.
